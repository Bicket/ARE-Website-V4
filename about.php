                    <p>
                        We are committed to being the place where team oriented gamers that value strategy, communication, coordination, and collaboration with others can enjoy themselves, build friendships, and fight alongside other like-minded individuals in an organized environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to be a community unlike any other. Through things like our professional administrative team and public relations policy, to the exclusive resources and opportunities we offer our players. We strive to provide an atmosphere where each member feels valued, appreciated, and respected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We focus on creating an environment for community and team building, knowledge and learning, and friendly competition. We want people to be able to practice, compete, relax, and battle together within a structured and friendly environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aim to be a team involved specifically with the first person shooter (FPS) genre, and within games where teamwork is required above all else. We are a PlayStation community founded on PS3, now predominantly based on PS4, and with goals to expand and grow wherever life takes us.

                    <p>
                        Alpha Rangers Elite was founded December 6, 2013 by two like minded individuals who valued real teamwork and communication in online First-Person-Shooters. Through intentional planning and organization ARE grew rapidly in the spring of 2014. This growth continues today and we are truly fortunate to have such a supportive community of players. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No matter what the future holds our goal is to make ARE flexible to change - while staying true to our roots and never losing our commitment to the players. Our desire is to be a place where people from all different backgrounds can play the game the way it was meant to be played, enjoying the benefits of a well organized team while contributing in their own unique way to it’s success.
