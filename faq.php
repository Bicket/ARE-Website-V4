                            ARE is the premier battlefield community for team-oriented gamers on PlayStation 4. We strive for quality over quantity in all that we do, offering only the best in resources and opportunities for our team! Because of this we decide to use Discord as our primary communication platform in the team. If you are familiar with Skype or Teamspeak you will feel right at home here on Discord. What we use Discord for:

                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Team announcements.</b> Forget having to scroll through pages of forums... Get smart notifications on your phone, computer, or web browser keeping you updated with the latest happenings in ARE.</li>
                                <li><b>Find people to squad up.</b> It takes an average of <i>2 minutes</i> for someone to respond back to your request for teammates! Never enter the battlefield alone again!</li>
                                <li><b>Cross-party communication.</b> It is not uncommon for there to be multiple ARE PSN Parties up at one time. We use Discord to communicate between these parties through the use of text/voice channels.</li>
                                <li><b>Competitive matches!</b> Setting up competitive battles are a breeze. View the current battle channel for rules, match updates, and practice times. You can even join in on the conversation as we talk strats! </li>
                                <li><b>Mobile App. Browser compatible. Sync across multiple devices. Great interface. </b></li>
                            </ol>

                               A Prospect is someone who has applied and is in the recruitment process to join ARE  but is not a member of ARE. During this “prospect phase” players are given the opportunity to play with us and get a real taste of what it's like to play as part of a team. We also use this time as an opportunity to get to know you as a PLAYER and as a PERSON.

                            Yes!! We hold practices often and participate in at least one clan battle every month, if not more. These battles are highly competitive and involve a lot of organizing and planning - even still we really enjoy doing them! Anyone in ARE has the opportunity to participate in competitive battles. That being said there are 3 ways that we go about choosing the roster: 

                            <ol>
                                <li><b><i>Most common</i>. First come, first serve.</b> For example: A 10v10 match is announced and the first 10 to sign up get to participate.</li>
                                <li><b><i>Common</i>. Attendance at practice lands you a spot on the roster. </b> For example: A 20v20 match is announced along with a list of practices leading up to the match. Out of those who attend the practices 20 people are chosen to play in the match.</li>
                                <li><b><i>Occasionally</i>. Roster is chosen by the event organizer.</b> For example: A 5v5 match is announced and the event organizer chooses who participates.</li>
                            </ol>

                            We are currently involved with or have been a part of tournaments, leagues, and events through the following organizations: <br><b>eSports Battlefield (ESB) , Electronic Sports League (ESL), Fragged Nation (FN), Glory 4 Gamers (G4G), and others.</b>
